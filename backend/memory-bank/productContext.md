# Product Context

This document explains the "why" behind the project, focusing on the problems it solves, how it should work from a user perspective, and the desired user experience.

## Problem Solved:

- **Lack of Data Control:** Users often have limited control over their health data when stored on third-party cloud platforms. `fasten-onprem` addresses this by allowing users to host their data on their own infrastructure.
- **Data Privacy Concerns:** Storing sensitive health information with external providers can raise privacy concerns. An on-premise solution gives users greater assurance of privacy.
- **Data Sovereignty Requirements:** Some individuals or organizations have strict requirements about where their data is stored (e.g., within a specific geographic location or on private networks).
- **Desire for Offline Access/Local Network Access:** An on-premise solution can provide reliable access to health data even without internet connectivity or for use solely within a local network.
- **Customization and Integration Needs:** Users with technical expertise might want to customize or integrate their health data platform more deeply than cloud solutions allow.

## How it Should Work (User Perspective):

1.  **Installation & Setup:** A technically proficient user (or their IT department) downloads and installs the `fasten-onprem` server on their chosen hardware/VM. They configure it using `config.yaml`, setting up database connections and other parameters.
2.  **Data Ingestion/Connection:** Users connect their health data sources to `fasten-onprem`. (The exact mechanism for this is not detailed in the current backend code but is a logical next step for a health platform).
3.  **Data Management & Access:** Users access and manage their aggregated health data through a web interface served by `fasten-onprem`. They can view, and potentially analyze or export their information.
4.  **Maintenance:** Users are responsible for maintaining the server, including updates, backups, and monitoring. The `migrate` command assists with database schema updates.

## User Experience Goals:

- **Empowerment:** Users should feel empowered by having full control and ownership of their health data.
- **Security & Trust:** The system should instill confidence that their data is secure and private.
- **Reliability:** The server should be stable and performant.
- **Control & Transparency:** Users should have clear visibility into how their data is managed and be able to configure the system to their needs.
- **Manageability:** For technical users, the system should be reasonably easy to deploy, configure, and maintain.

## Target Audience (Detailed):

- **Privacy-Conscious Individuals:** Tech-savvy individuals who want maximum control over their personal health records and are capable of managing a personal server.
- **Developers & Researchers:** Those who need a self-hosted platform for health data to build custom applications, conduct research, or integrate with other systems, while maintaining data control.
- **Small Clinics or Organizations:** Smaller healthcare providers or organizations that need a local, manageable health data solution and may have specific data sovereignty or privacy requirements.
- **Enthusiasts/Hobbyists:** Individuals interested in personal health informatics and self-hosting.

Their primary pain points revolve around the opacity, potential insecurity, and lack of control associated with entrusting sensitive health data to third-party cloud services.

## Value Proposition:

- **Full Data Ownership:** The primary value is giving users complete control and ownership of their health data by hosting it on their own terms.
- **Enhanced Privacy & Security:** Reduces risks associated with third-party data breaches or unwanted data access by keeping data within the user's trusted environment.
- **Flexibility & Customization:** An on-premise solution offers greater potential for customization and integration compared to standardized cloud offerings.
- **Compliance Enablement:** Helps users or organizations meet specific data residency or sovereignty requirements.

## Success Criteria (Product-focused):

- **Adoption:** Steady adoption by the target audience segments.
- **User Satisfaction:** Positive feedback regarding data control, privacy, reliability, and ease of management (for technical users).
- **Community Engagement:** (If applicable) Growth of a user community, contributions, or active discussions.
- **Stability & Performance:** The server operates reliably and efficiently under expected loads.
- **Security:** No major security vulnerabilities reported or exploited.

## User Stories or Use Cases (Optional):

- "As a privacy-conscious individual, I want to host my health records on my own server so I have full control over who can access them and how they are used."
- "As a healthcare researcher, I want a self-hosted platform to securely manage de-identified patient data for my studies, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations."
- "As a small clinic, I want an on-premise system to manage patient records locally, ensuring data remains within our physical control and meets local data sovereignty laws."

## Notes:

The product context heavily emphasizes user control, data privacy, and the benefits of a self-hosted solution, aligning with the "on-premise" nature of `fasten-onprem`.
