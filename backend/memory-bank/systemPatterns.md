# System Patterns

This document details the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, component relationships, and critical implementation paths.

## System Architecture:

The project follows a backend server architecture with a command-line interface (CLI) entry point. It appears to utilize a layered design, separating concerns into distinct Go packages such as `config`, `database`, `web`, `event_bus`, and `resources`. The core application (`cmd/fasten/fasten.go`) orchestrates these components based on CLI commands. An internal event bus facilitates decoupled communication between different parts of the system.

## Key Technical Decisions:

- **Language:** Go was chosen as the primary development language.
- **CLI Framework:** `github.com/urfave/cli/v2` is used for building the command-line interface, providing structure for commands like `start`, `version`, and `migrate`.
- **Logging:** `github.com/sirupsen/logrus` is used for structured logging, allowing for flexible configuration of log levels and output destinations.
- **Configuration Management:** A dedicated `config` package handles loading settings from a YAML file (`config.yaml`) and command-line flags, providing a centralized configuration source.
- **Dependency Management:** Go Modules are used for managing external and internal dependencies.
- **Resource Embedding:** The `//go:embed` directive is used to embed static resources like `related_versions.json` directly into the binary.
- **On-Premise Deployment:** The fundamental decision is to provide an on-premise solution, influencing architecture towards self-contained deployment and local data management.

## Design Patterns in Use:

- **Factory Pattern:** Used in the `config` package (`config/factory.go`) to create configuration instances.
- **Interface Segregation Principle / Dependency Injection:** An `Interface` is defined for the configuration (`config/interface.go`), allowing components to depend on an abstraction rather than a concrete implementation. This facilitates testing and modularity.
- **Event Bus Pattern:** An internal event bus (`event_bus` package) is used for communication between components, promoting decoupling.

## Component Relationships:

- The main application (`cmd/fasten/fasten.go`) initializes and connects various core components (`config`, `database`, `event_bus`, `web`).
- The `web.AppEngine` component depends on `config`, `logrus` (via `CreateLogger`), `event_bus`, and `resources` to start the web server.
- The `migrate` CLI command interacts with the `database` package to perform migrations, also depending on `config`, `logrus`, and `event_bus`.
- The `resources` package provides access to embedded data, used by components like `web.AppEngine`.
- The `config` package is a dependency for most other core components, providing application settings.
- The `database` package encapsulates database logic, likely used by the `web` component and the `migrate` command.
- The `event_bus` package is used by components that need to publish or subscribe to internal events.

## Critical Implementation Paths:

- **Application Startup:** The sequence in `cmd/fasten/fasten.go` involving configuration loading, logger creation, and starting the `web.AppEngine` or running `migrate`.
- **Configuration Loading and Validation:** The process within the `config` package to read `config.yaml`, process overrides, and validate settings.
- **Database Migration Execution:** The logic within the `migrate` command and the `database` package to apply schema changes.
- **Web Server Request Handling:** (Details not yet fully visible, but involves the `web` package processing incoming requests).

## Data Flow:

- Configuration data flows from `config.yaml` and CLI/environment variables into the `config` package, and then is accessed by other components.
- Embedded resource data (`related_versions.json`) is loaded by the `resources` package and used by components like the `web` server.
- Database interactions (reads/writes) are handled by the `database` package.
- Events flow through the `event_bus` between different components.
- Log data flows from various components to `logrus` and then to STDOUT/STDERR or a log file.

## Notes:

- The project structure is modular, with clear package boundaries.
- The use of interfaces and a factory for configuration suggests an emphasis on testability and flexibility.
- The event bus implies asynchronous operations or inter-component messaging.
