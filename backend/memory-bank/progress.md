# Progress

This document tracks the project's status, including what is working, what is left to build, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.

## What Works:

- **Core CLI Structure:** The `cmd/fasten/fasten.go` file defines a working CLI structure with commands for `start`, `version`, and `migrate` using `urfave/cli/v2`.
- **Basic Configuration Loading:** The `config` package can read a `config.yaml` file and process command-line flags.
- **Logging Initialization:** `logrus` is initialized, and basic logging is functional.
- **Version Information:** The application can display version information.
- **Resource Embedding:** `related_versions.json` is embedded and can be read.
- **Memory Bank Foundation:** The core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `techContext.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`) have been populated with initial, inferred information.

## What's Left to Build:

- **Detailed Application Features:** Most specific functionalities of the `fasten-onprem` health platform (e.g., data ingestion, detailed web interface features, API endpoints, specific health data processing logic).
- **Complete Database Integration:** While a `database` package and `migrate` command exist, the specific database schema and full integration are likely pending. The database type itself is TBD.
- **Web Interface Functionality:** The `web` package exists, but the actual features and UI of the web interface served are not yet detailed.
- **Event Bus Implementation Details:** The purpose and specific events handled by the `event_bus` need further definition.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Beyond basic error checks, robust error handling across the application.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Security Hardening:** Detailed security measures and hardening.
- **User Documentation:** End-user documentation for deploying and using `fasten-onprem`.
- **CLI Name Placeholder:** Update the CLI application name and description in `cmd/fasten/fasten.go`.

## Current Status:

- **Initial Setup and Documentation Phase:** The project is in its very early stages. The current focus is on establishing foundational documentation within the Memory Bank by analyzing existing code.
- The core backend structure is present, but significant feature development is pending.

## Known Issues:

- **Incomplete Memory Bank:** `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` are currently being populated for the first time. Other Memory Bank files have been populated with inferred information and may require further refinement as more project details emerge.
- **Undefined Database:** Resolved. SQLite has been selected as the database technology.
- **Placeholder CLI Name:** The CLI app name in `fasten.go` is "goweb" with usage "Example go web application," which seems like a placeholder. The project itself is `fasten-onprem`.

## Evolution of Decisions:

- **Initial State:** Project started with template Memory Bank files and some existing Go code.
- **Current Approach:** Systematically analyzing existing code and user input to populate the Memory Bank files one by one, starting with foundational documents. This iterative process aims to build a comprehensive understanding of the project.

## Completed Tasks (Optional):

- Analyzed existing Go files (`cmd/fasten/fasten.go`, `resources/*`, `pkg/constants.go`, `pkg/config/*`) to infer project details.
- Drafted and saved initial versions of:
    - `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
    - `memory-bank/techContext.md`
    - `memory-bank/productContext.md`
    - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
- Currently drafting `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md`.

## Notes:

This progress document reflects the project's state as of the initial Memory Bank setup. It will evolve significantly as development proceeds.
