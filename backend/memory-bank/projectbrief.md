# Project Brief

This document serves as the foundational document for the project, outlining its core requirements, goals, and overall vision.

## Project Name:

fasten-onprem

## Project Goals:

- Provide an on-premise backend server.
- Offer a web application/server.
- Manage configurations effectively via YAML files and CLI flags.
- Provide database migration capabilities.

## Core Requirements:

- Start and manage a web server.
- Handle application configuration from `config.yaml` and command-line arguments.
- Implement robust logging with configurable levels and output to file or STDOUT.
- Perform and manage database migrations.
- Display application version information.
- Integrate with an internal event bus system for decoupled communication.

## Vision:

To offer a self-hostable version of the Fasten Health platform, allowing users to securely manage their health data locally, ensuring data privacy and control.

## Scope:

**Included:**
- Backend server logic for core functionalities.
- A web interface component served by the backend.
- Comprehensive configuration management.
- Database schema management and migration tools.
- Event handling and processing.
- Detailed application logging.

**Likely Excluded (or handled by other components):**
- Dedicated frontend UI development (beyond the web component served by the backend).
- Extensive external third-party integrations beyond core dependencies.

## Stakeholders:

- **Primary Author/Developer:** Jason Kulatunga (jason@thesparktree.com)
- **Users:** Individuals or organizations seeking to self-host Fasten Health for enhanced data control.
- **Fasten Health:** The organization developing and supporting the project.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

*(Examples, to be refined as project matures)*
- High server uptime and reliability.
- Efficient request processing speed.
- Growing number of active installations.
- Ease of deployment and setup for new users.
- Consistently successful and error-free data migrations.

## Target Audience:

- Technically proficient users, developers, or organizations capable of deploying and maintaining an on-premise Go application.
- Users and entities prioritizing data privacy, ownership, and control, who prefer a self-hosted solution for managing health information.

## Initial Thoughts/Notes:

The project is a Go-based backend system, likely serving as the core for the Fasten Health on-premise offering. It includes CLI commands for starting the server, managing versions, and handling database migrations.
