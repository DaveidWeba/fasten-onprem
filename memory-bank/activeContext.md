# Active Context: Fasten On-Prem (Project Overview Refresh)

## Current Focus

The primary active task is a full refresh and update of the project's memory bank. This involves analyzing the entire `fasten-onprem` monorepo structure to generate up-to-date documentation for:

*   `projectbrief.md`: High-level overview of the project.
*   `productContext.md`: Understanding the product's features, target audience, and vision.
*   `techContext.md`: Detailing the technologies, languages, frameworks, and tools used.
*   `systemPatterns.md`: Identifying key architectural and design patterns.
*   `activeContext.md`: (This file) Documenting the current state of this refresh process.
*   `progress.md`: Outlining the overall progress and next steps for the project (from a general standpoint).
*   `.clinerules/memory-bank.md`: Defining rules or guidelines for maintaining this memory bank.

## Project State Summary

*   **Repository:** `/Users/vadim/Projects/fasten-onprem`
*   **Structure:** Monorepo containing:
    *   `backend/`: Go application.
    *   `frontend/`: Angular application.
    *   Configuration files for Docker, Nix, Go, Yarn, Angular, etc.
    *   `scripts/`: Utility scripts.
    *   `memory-bank/`: Documentation and context files (currently being updated).
*   **Key Technologies Identified:** Go (backend), Angular/TypeScript (frontend), Docker, Nix, Git.
*   **Primary Domain:** Healthcare/Medical data management, with strong support for FHIR standards.

## Next Steps in this Refresh

1.  Finalize content for `activeContext.md`.
2.  Generate content for `progress.md`.
3.  Generate content for `.clinerules/memory-bank.md`.
4.  Review all generated content with the user.
5.  Once approved, proceed to write the new content to the respective files.

## Potential Future Work (Beyond this Refresh)

Once the memory bank is up-to-date, potential next steps for the `fasten-onprem` project itself could involve:
*   Feature development based on the product vision (e.g., enhancing existing medical data modules, adding new integrations).
*   Refactoring or performance optimization in backend or frontend.
*   Updating dependencies.
*   Expanding test coverage.
